<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
This project is meant as an example website on how to use AngularJS and Bootstrap to show orders. You can search through the orders. Extend the website as you see fit.
</p>

<h2>How to customise the website to your needs</h2>
<ul>
<li>I only gave an order a number and a description. Add new order fields in a similar way. The search-box automatically also searches through any new order fields you add.</li>
<li>Some orders are added to the website as an example. You'll need to provide/call a webservice to get the orders you need.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS should be installed including the webserver and the npm packet manager</li>
<li>Bower should be installed</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to set up your own development environment</h2>
<ol>
<li>Get the code</li>
<li>Use the <code>npm install</code> to install the NodeJS dependencies.</li>
<li>Use <code>bower install</code> to install all bower dependencies</li>
<li>Use <code>npm start</code> to host the website on <code>localhost:8000</code></li>
</ol>
